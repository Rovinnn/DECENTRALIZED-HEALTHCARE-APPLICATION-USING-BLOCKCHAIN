# Decentralized Healthcare System

This repository contains the code and documentation for a decentralized healthcare system leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, Kubo IPFS, Ganache, Truffle, and MetaMask. The project aims to improve data security, privacy, and interoperability in healthcare by storing medical records on decentralized storage and enabling smart contract-based access control.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Blockchain-backed medical record integrity
- 🗃️ Decentralized storage using Kubo IPFS for high availability and tamper resistance
- ⚙️ Smart contracts in Solidity for patient-consented data sharing
- 🧪 Truffle framework for testing and deployment
- 🧱 Ganache for local Ethereum development
- 🦊 MetaMask integration for secure patient/provider interaction

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- Solidity
- IPFS (Kubo)
- Truffle & Ganache
- Ethereum
- MetaMask
- React.js (frontend – optional if applicable)
